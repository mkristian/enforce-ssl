h1. Enforce SSL for you controllers

p. this is derived from the http://github.org/rails/ssl_requirement:rails/ssl_requirement and adopted a more strict approach: security everything and open where needed.

p. info about the actual gem please look into the directory http://github.org/mkristian/ixtlan-guard/gem:enforce-ssl-gem

h2. demo rails application

p. the http://github.org/mkristian/ixtlan-guard/gem:demo is a sample rails3 application with integration tests. see readme how to start the application and what limitations apply.

h2. run all the tests + integrations-tests in one go

p. first you need jruby for this ! then you need to install

bc.         jruby -S gem 'ruby-maven'

p. which allows to run the integration-tests from the demo with jetty.

p. now you can execute

bc.         rmvn verify
