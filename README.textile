h1. Enforce SSL for you controllers

p. with the advent of hijacking tools for dummies like "firesheep":http://codebutler.github.com/firesheep the need for securing your sessions with ssl is there.

p. this is derived from the "rails/ssl_requirement":http://github.org/rails/ssl_requirement and adopted a more strict approach: *secure everything and open it where needed*.

p. info about the actual gem please look into the directory "enforce-ssl-gem":http://github.org/mkristian/enforce-ssl/tree/master/enforce-ssl-gem

h2. demo rails application

p. the "demo":http://github.org/mkristian/enforce-ssl/tree/master/demo is a sample rails3 application with integration tests. see "readme":http://github.org/mkristian/enforce-ssl/tree/master/demo/README.textile how to start the application and what limitations apply.

h2. run all the tests + integrations-tests in one go

p. first you need jruby for this ! then you need to install

bc.         jruby -S gem 'ruby-maven'

p. which allows to run the integration-tests from the demo with jetty.

p. now you can execute

bc.         rmvn verify
